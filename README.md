## Pomodoro-timer

is an application with which you can keep track of time while
doing something important and take breaks on time for a good result.

You can see the project  <a href="https://pomodoro-amado.netlify.app/">Here</a>

#### In it I used the following technologies:
* React
* Redux-toolkit
* React-router-dom
* Chart.js
* Use-sound

---

#### functions that I have implemented.
I made three buttons: 
* "Pomodoro"  
* "Short Break" 
* "Long Break" 

When you press Pomodoro, time starts to pass and you can work <br>
when the time runs out, the time goes to 'Short Break', you just have to press the button again and rest.
You also have a box showing how many Pomodoros you completed '0/4' <br>
after completing all Pomodoros, you enter 'Long Break' mode
and you can rest well.
for easy tracking, I made a Report menu - where you can see how much you have worked for each day during the week.

#### And I also made a settings menu where you can change the Pomodoro time, Short break, Long break and interval Long Break.
And yet, I forgot to tell you, in the settings, you can change the sound that sounds when your time is up.
